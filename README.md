# *Everyone Today:* a wall for everyone to leave some words anonymously.

## What's this?
*Everyone Today* is an API where everyone can post something and sign with any name, so others can get those words. The fact is that every username can only be used once every X amount of time (24h by default).

## Currently on development. It is not usable yet.
